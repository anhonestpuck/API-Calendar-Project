# API-Calendar-Project

## Acceptance criteria
// GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
// WHEN I open the planner
// THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
// WHEN I scroll down
// THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
// WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
// THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
// WHEN I click into a timeblock
// THEN I can enter an event
// WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
// THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
// WHEN I refresh the page
// THEN the saved events persist

## Process
I kept getting stuck and frustrated.  It seems to take me much longer than most but I'm pretty sure I got it together in the end.
